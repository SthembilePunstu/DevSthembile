    <h2>Hi, I'm Sthembile Sithole</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a motivated and forward-thinking student currently pursuing a <strong>Diploma in Business Information Technology</strong> at the University of Johannesburg.
      I’m passionate about combining technology with business to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming, data handling, system design, and business processes.
      I’m especially interested in areas like digital transformation, IT strategy, and software development.
      I enjoy working with tools like Python, HTML, CSS, and the Microsoft Office Suite.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm committed to lifelong learning and continuously improving my skills.
      When I’m not coding or studying, I’m exploring new technologies, solving problems, and working on personal projects that challenge me creatively and technically.
